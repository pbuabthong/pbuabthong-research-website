I'm an assistant professor of Physics at Nakhon Ratchasima Rajabhat University. My research interests span from ML to AI for science, where science here includes both natural science (materials property predictions) and social science (disaster management and poverty alleviation)

Previously, I was working with [Prof. Nathan S. Lewis](https://nsl.caltech.edu) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu)
on surface energetics and defects of protective coatings for photoelectrochemical solar fuel production devices.
During my Ph.D., I was also working [Prof. Zachary Ross](https://ross.caltech.edu) on systhetic broadband seismic wave generation using
generative adversarial networks (GANs)
