### tl;dr

- We've developed an approach combining LED-based optical scattering with #YOLOv8 object detection
- Instead of a traditional method where you have to wait for a bacteria culture, then maybe use laser to identify the type of bacterias, we proposed an approach using optical scattering of the bacteria colony from RGB-LEDS for rapid identification. 
- By using LEDs to take three R-G-B photos sequentially, we are able to capture three channels of the image with a slightly parallax pattern, providing model with richer information. Additionally, this LED setup is low-cost and allow for easy integration with the lab's existing workflow. There's also no need to open the culture plate, reducing the contamination risk. 
- In our experiments, we focuses on E. Coli and S. Aureus and were able to identify S. Aureus MRSA 1320, a major health threat, accurately (mAP50 > 0.98) within 24 hr.
