### tl;dr
- ZnO nanoparticles have been used in various application due to their large band-gap and high catalytic activity.
- These ZnO nanoparticles, when made into nano-sheets, have been reported to show high catalytic activity (mostly because of higher surface area)
- In addition to activity, a good absorption is also needed to make an efficient 'photo'-catalyst; doping ZnO with bismuth changes its optical absorption properties. 
- In this work, we made ZnO nano-sheets using co-precipitation, a very simple and straight-forward technique that doesn't require any extensive laboratory setup. 
- The nanoparticles were also doped with bismuth by introducing Bi precursor during the precipitation process. 
- We performed a set of standard characterization processes (XRD, SEM, UV-Vis) and discusses how the specific deposition conditions we used led to nano-sheet formation

### Comments
- When doping a semiconductor, don't confuse the dopant's effect on the band-gap and the conductivity type. 
- The effect of dopants in the lattice is predominantly the change in Fermi level (i.e., changing from n-type to p-type). Sometimes, the band gap may change (as observed in this work), but it's due to the **shrinkage effect** rather than the dopants being donors/acceptors of electrons.
